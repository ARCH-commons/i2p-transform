 - dx_source forced to FI for AV
 - vital_source set to HC

## Version 6.1 for MSSQL and v6 for Oracle

*12/10/15* - release of "version 6.1" for SQL Server and "version 6" for Oracle:

- MSSQL and Oracle: Bug fixes in prescribing/dispensing - please re-run
- MSSQL: Speed optimizations in prescribing, dispensing, labs, condition, and diagnosis. Now each transform runs on 2m patients at Partners in <30m.
- Note that the Oracle version was adapted by colleagues at Wake Forest and has not been tested by SCILHS Central.

# Version 0.6.1 for MSSQL and Oracle (12/17/15)

- MSSQL and Oracle versions are once again equivalent. 
- Versioning schema changed from 6.x to 0.6.x
